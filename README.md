# Classification_

The resample program evaluates over sampling, under sampling and combination machine-learning models to predict credit risk using free data from LendingClub.
Oversample uses `Naive Random Oversampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms.
Undersample uses `Cluster Centroids` algorithm.
Combination uses `SMOTEENN` algorithm.

The ensemble program train and compare Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier machine-learning models to predict credit risk using free data from LendingClub.
