# Classification_

Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data. The process starts with predicting the class of given data points. The classes are often referred to as target, label or categories.

The classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating the mapping function from input variables to discrete output variables. The main goal is to identify which class/category the new data will fall into.

The resample program evaluates over sampling, under sampling and combination machine-learning models to predict credit risk using free data from LendingClub.
Oversample uses `Naive Random Oversampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms.
Undersample uses `Cluster Centroids` algorithm.
Combination uses `SMOTEENN` algorithm.

The ensemble program train and compare Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier machine-learning models to predict credit risk using free data from LendingClub.
